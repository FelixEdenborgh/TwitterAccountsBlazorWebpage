The website I created serves as a central hub for various types of media, integrating content from multiple sources such as RSS feeds and Twitter streams. The idea was to present a balanced view of the latest media, avoiding political bias, and offering content from both left- and right-leaning outlets. Additionally, it features content specific to Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), motivational media, Swedish news, and global news coverage.

### Key Features:
- **RSS Feed Integration**: The site pulls in the latest media from major news sources via RSS feeds. This allows users to access the most recent articles and updates from their preferred outlets.
- **Twitter Integration**: Alongside the RSS feeds, the site displays live Twitter feeds. I built a custom solution that fetches Twitter feeds and presents them alongside the other content, ensuring users get real-time updates.
- **Affiliate Marketing**: The site also displays affiliate information, providing a revenue stream by linking to related products and services.

### Technologies Used:
- **Blazor .NET 8**: I built the site using the latest version of Blazor, a modern web framework for building interactive web applications using C#.
- **Azure Hosting**: The entire site is hosted on Microsoft Azure, providing reliable and scalable infrastructure.
- **C#**: The core programming language I used to handle both the RSS and Twitter feed integrations, ensuring that data is fetched efficiently and displayed in a user-friendly format.

This project is designed to streamline media consumption by aggregating content from multiple sources into one place, providing users with a comprehensive, real-time media experience.
